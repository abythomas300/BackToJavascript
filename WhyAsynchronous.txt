JS is a single threaded programming language.
This means that JS engine has only one call stack.
Therefore, it can only do one task at a time.
It may cause time wastage(Talking about time in terms of ms.)

To increase efficiency of single threaded engine, we use asynchronous programming.
That means doing another task while waiting for the previous task to get completed.
